<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Isolated white-sand beaches, reefs teeming with marine life, cascading rice terraces – it’s no wonder that the Philippines is thought of as paradise. And there’s even more than meets the eye, from the world’s smallest primate to the unique hanging coffins of Sagada. Yet, with well over 7,000 islands you can get overwhelmed by what’s on offer. Whatever kind of trip you’re after, here’s our guide to the best islands in the Philippines.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">For beaches and wildlife: Palawan</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="PHOTOS\3.jpg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">The Philippines’ eco-island remains a firm backpacker favourite. Palawan’s capital, Puerto Princesa is carbon-neutral, while the island and its beaches have collected countless accolades – particularly for the jaw-dropping Nacpan Beach near El Nido. For many, a visit to Palawan is all about getting out on the water.
Once there you can go island-hopping between hidden coves and deserted beaches, and snorkelling in the coral reef-filled waters. For many, the island’s main attraction is the famous Puerto Princesa Underground River. One of the ‘New 7 Wonders of Nature' – the river runs for 8.2km underneath the St Paul Mountain Range.
A fascinating underwater world is ready to be explored. Coron is known for its wreck diving while El Nido has one of the most beautiful islands in the Philippines, hidden lagoons, and hundreds of species of coral and marine life. This tailor-made diving adventure in Palawan allows you to discover both places, above and below the water.

<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">While many islands in the Philippines are full of excellent snorkelling and scuba diving opportunities, Mindoro goes the extra mile. Some 30km off the coast lies the Mindoro. It's one of the world’s most spectacular and important reefs, with over 450 different species of coral.
Once you're at the reef you'll see all sorts of marine life, from giant schools of tuna to barracudas, sharks, sea turtles and manta rays. Other top dive sites around Mindoro can be accessed from the popular town of Mindoro, which is situated on the north side of the island.

<CENTER><img src="IMG\CHOCOLATE HILLS.jpeg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Part of the Visayas group of islands in the Philippines, Bohol is a nature paradise packed with national parks, spectacular beaches and cascading waterfalls. Many people visit to see the famous Chocolate Hills – over a thousand rounded hills, that turn chocolate brown in the dry season. Bohol offers numerous encounters with wildlife – the highlight being a chance to see tarsiers. These tiny, saucer-eyed creatures are the world’s smallest primates. On this tailor-made Total immersion in Visayas you will get to know Cebu with its waterfalls and some of the best islands in the Philippines before heading to Dumaguete to swim with turtles and over to Bohol: known for its chocolate hills and tarsiers, this island never ceases to amaze. A few more beach days in Siquijor conclude this trip.

<CENTER><img src="PIC\Boracay(1).jpg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5"> Philippines on our list. The island hit the headlines in 2018 when the Philippines government announced it was 'closing' the island.

Here you’ll find many of the top international chains of hotels and resorts. On top of that, there are plenty of beach bars and clubs – especially around White Beach and Bulabog Beach. Adrenaline seekers will be spoilt for choice here with a range of water sports and other adventures on offer. Options range from windsurfing, kitesurfing and parasailing to cliff diving, horse riding and sailing.
Discover two paradise islands in the Philippines with our tailor-made trip to Boracay & Palawan. Enjoy luxurious hotels, white sandy beaches, a fascinating underwater world and the hospitality of the local population.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">For diversity: Luzon</FONT></P>
<CENTER><img src="PIC\Luzon.jpeg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">The Philippines’ biggest and most densely populated island, Luzon, is home to the nation’s capital Manila, with its bustling traffic-clogged streets and swanky shopping malls. North of Manila, this vast island unravels a range of sights. You can see everything from 2,000-year-old rice terraces and Sagada’s hanging coffins to the historic colonial city of Vigan.
Meanwhile, Southern Luzon is known for its coconut-infused cuisine, wild windswept eastern coastline and the perfectly conical Mt Mayon – the Philippines’ most active volcano.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue"> For surfing: Siargao</FONT><P>
<CENTER><img src="PHOTOS\sia.jpg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<p>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Off the northeastern tip of Mindanao lies the teardrop-shaped island of Siargao, a largely undeveloped backwater with Boracay-type beaches and dramatic coves and lagoons. Siargao has got everything, with a typically tropical coastal landscape of palm trees and dazzling seas, and a verdant hinterland of rustic little barrios and coconut groves.
Some of the first tourists here were surfers, who discovered a break at Tuason Point that was so good they called it Cloud 9, and though it’s still off the tourist trail, word-of-mouth is bringing an increasing number of surfers from around the world.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">For island hopping: Pangasinan</FONT></P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\hundred-islands.jpg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Island hopping in the Philippines is a popular tourist activity, and one of the best places to do this is Hundred Islands National Park. Pangasinan on the western side of Luzon is a travel-worthy destination in the Philippines because of its scenic islands, beautiful beaches, stunning waterfalls, verdant hills, and many more.
One of its most popular attractions is called the Hundred Islands National Park, a protected area and the Philippines’ first national park. A Pangasinan Hundred Islands island-hopping tour will give you access to some of the 124 islands and islets off Alaminos, Pangasinan.

<Font Face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size=" 5" color="Blue">For better experience:Cebu</FONT></P>
<CENTER><img src="IMG\cebu.jpg" HEIGHT="10%" WIDTH="100%" TITLE="Book Your Visit Now!"></CENTER>
<font face="Times New Romasn" size="5">Cebu in the Visayas is blessed with pristine islands, white sand beaches, diving spots with colorful underwater ecosystems, and historical and picturesque land attractions.
</p>
<p>It's one of the most popular island destinations in the Philippines and is often included in the world's best islands. It also has its own international Cebu airport that services direct flights from different countries and is accessible to many Cebu hotels. 
</p>
<p>When planning your Cebu itinerary, you can choose from North and South of Cebu. In northern Cebu, you can go island-hopping in Camotes Island, Bantayan Island, or Malapascua. When you go to the south, you can travel to Moalboal to experience the sardine run, join the adrenaline-pumping canyoneering tours to Kawasan Falls, or hike Osmeña Peak. 
Island-hopping in Mactan is a good option if you have limited time since it's the nearest to the airport. Common stops include a trip to Nalusuan Island and Hilutungan Island, Olango Island, and Pandanon Island. 
Trips often begin at Hilutungan Island since it is the nearest to the mainland and is a protected area. Hilutungan is Cebu's oldest marine sanctuary. It is excellent for snorkeling and diving because of the rich diversity of its marine life. Keep on the lookout for schools of giant trevally and a lot of batfish!
Blessed with hectares of mangroves and mudflats, Olango Island is great for bird watching. It is one of the stops for migratory birds from Siberia and China, including some endangered species. Commonly seen here are egrets, herons, terns, kingfishers, fly-eaters, and totlers.
Birds can reach more than 40,000 during peak season, which is between November and May. Be sure to drop by at sunrise or sunset for the best chances of seeing them, as they come out to feed during these hours.
